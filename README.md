# U-Net-with-PyTorch
This is a Pytorch based implementation of U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation which was originally given in this paper. Although originally given for biomedical image segmentation, this architecture has been employed for various image segmentation tasks.
# Datasets
I have used the Caravana Image masking challenge dataset from kaggle for this task.
